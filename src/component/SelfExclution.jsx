                <p>This policy outlines the commitment of yebet to taking a responsible approach to gambling and its potential effects on individuals.While subscription-based society lotteries offer the lowest risk of problem gambling, it is recognised that some players are unable to enjoy participation in such activity.</p>

                <h1 className='font-semibold mb-2 mt-2 text-2xl'>How long does self-exclusion extend to?</h1>
                <p>The minimum self-exclusion period is not less than 6 months nor more than 12 months. The exclusion period may be extended in 6 monthly increments following the end of the exclusion period.

                    In terms of remote gambling, e.g. website and telephony sign ups, the individual must be given the option to exclude for up to 5 years. At the end of the chosen exclusion period the self-exclusion remains in place for a further 7 years unless the individual takes positive action to gamble again.</p>
                <p>In terms of non-remote gambling, e.g. sign up by coupon, at the end of the exclusion period the self- exclusion remains in place for a further 6 months unless the individual takes positive action to gamble again.

                    If an individual chooses not to extend their self-exclusion, and makes any positive request to begin gambling again during the 6-month period in terms of non-remote gambling or the 7-year period in terms of remote gambling following the end of their self-exclusion, they will be given 24 hours to cool off before being allowed participate in the lottery.

                    Irrespective of the expiry of the period of self-exclusion chosen by an individual, no marketing material will be sent to them unless and until they have asked for or agreed to accept such material.</p>

                <h1 className='font-semibold mb-2 mt-2 text-2xl'>Personal responsibilities</h1>
                <p>In requesting self-exclusion, the individual agrees to provide full and accurate personal details, now and in the future, so as to ensure we are able to restrict access to our services. If an individual does choose to self-exclude we will use all reasonable endeavours to ensure we comply with the self-exclusion.

                    However in agreeing to self-exclude the individual must accept that they have a parallel undertaking not to seek to circumvent the self-exclusion.

                    Accordingly, yebet, takes no responsibility or liability for any subsequent consequences or losses that an individual may suffer or incur if they commence or continue gambling by providing misleading, inaccurate or incomplete details or otherwise seek to circumvent the self-exclusion agreed.

                <p>Whilst the majority of people do gamble within their means, for some, gambling can become a problem. As part of our commitment to promoting socially responsible gambling, the following guidance is provided for the benefit of individuals who participate in the lotteries operated by yebet:

                    Gambling should be entertaining and not seen as a way of makingmoney
                    Avoid chasinglosses
                    Only gamble what you can afford tolose
                    Keep track of the time and amount you spendgambling</p>
